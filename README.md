Our project aims to address the mentioned gap and provide a new way of navigating through Spotify's musical offer. It consists of a web application that collects data from Spotify and other sources and allows users to navigate different genres, cultures, artists, and countries. They can request recommendations based on their mood, or search for the perfect track according to its characteristics
